# Chessable Practice Against Computer

Quickly open your current Chessable analysis position on Lichess to practice against the computer. I tried an existing Chrome extension in the Store but it didn't seem to work so I put this together.

## How to install

1. Download the folder chessable-practice-against-computer (this contains manifest.json and content.js)
2. Go to chrome://extensions/
3. Enable Developer Mode
4. Click Load unpacked
5. Select the chessable-practice-against-computer/ folder

## How to use

1. Open a Chessable 'Analysis Board' - take [this position as an example](https://www.chessable.com/analysis/fen/6k1U1q3pp1U2b4pU4Q3U1pp5U5PP1U1P2P1BPU6K1%20b%20-%20-%200%2031/?o=black)
2. A new button will appear on the right hand side of the screen 'Open in Lichess'
3. Click 'Open in Lichess'
4. The position will be opened in the Lichess Analysis Board
5. You can then click 'Practice with Computer' at the bottom right - the Bullseye icon ðŸŽ¯
